# Suri

Its a bash script that reads a tab delimited file cause there probably wont be a tab in a url. It makes a a folder with the name of the first field, then it uses a heredoc to throw an index.html into the folder that will redirect to the second field. 

forked from suri but only out of laziness and maybe a tad bit of spite.
